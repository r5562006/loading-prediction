# Decision Tree Project

This project uses a decision tree algorithm to classify data. The script includes functions for calculating information gain, choosing the best feature to split, and creating the decision tree.

## Project Structure

- `prediction.py`: The main script containing the decision tree algorithm.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision_tree_project.git
    cd decision_tree_project
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    # Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the `prediction.py` script to create and use the decision tree:
```sh
python prediction.py
